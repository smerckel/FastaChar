FastaChar's documentation
=========================

This manual covers the use of the program **Fastachar**.

FastaChar is a software developed to extract molecular diagnostic characters from
one or several taxonomically-informative DNA markers of a selected taxon
compared to those of other taxa (as many as required by the user) in a single step.
The input data consists of a single file with aligned sequences in the fasta format,
which can be created using alignment software such as MEGA or
GENEIOUS.

The software was developed specifically to determine molecular
diagnostic characters for the description of Lyrodus mersinensis by
Borges and Merckelbach (2018) [BORGES2018]_, but it can be applied to
any taxon.  Since FastaChar is an intuitive and easy-to-use software, we
hope it will contribute to speed up species descriptions by helping
taxonomists to use the standardized method for cryptic species.

**Fastachar** is written in Python3, and is released as open source
software under the GPLv3 GNU Public License. The installation of the
program is (also) covered in the README.rst file, that comes with the source
code.
