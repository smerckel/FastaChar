Fastachar Manual
================

This manual covers the use of the program *Fastachar*, which is aimed
at facilitating the comparison of pre-aligned DNA sequences between:

* a set of DNA sequences, thought to be a single species, and
* a set of DNA sequences of one or more different, but related
  species.

*Fastachar* is written in Python3, and is released as open source
software under the GPLv3 Gnu Public License. The installation of the
program is covered in the README.rst file, that comes with the source
code.

.. note::

   The *Fastachar* software is written for Python3. The use of
   Python2.x is currently not supported, although it probably does not
   require too much effort to modify it for Python2. If in doubt what
   to use, either Python2 or Python3, use Python3.
