Programming with **fasta**
==========================


The graphical user interface is intended to provide easy access to the
functionality offered by the **fasta** module. Rather than using the
graphical interface, the user can also create her/his own python scripts.

Example script
--------------

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/analysis_example.py 
    :linenos:
    :language: python


The advantage of using scripts such as the one above, is that it is
easier to redo an analysis, modify an existing one, or batch analyses
a number of fasta files.

The API for the class SequenceData can be consulted :ref:`modindex`.
